## Overview of the Analysis
For this analysis, the intent was to create a convincing business proposal for potential investors in a bike-sharing operation in Des Moines. The analysis below provides a comprehensive snapshot of bike trip data for the month of August.

<h3> Peak Hours </h3>

The above shows the hours of the day with the most rides. These hours are 8 AM, 4 PM, 5 PM, 6 PM, 7 PM. 

<h3> Checkout Times for Users </h3>

Here we can see that the majority of rides last for roughly 5 minutes, after which there is a significant drop off.

<h3> Checkout Times by Gender </h3>

Additionally, the data shows that while the peak checkout time for males and females is roughly 5-6 minutes, followed by a drop off, trip duration for females is more spread out with a less significant drop off. For unknown gender, the trip duration is spread pretty evenly between 7-25 minutes before there is a drop off. 

<h3> Hourly Trips per Day </h3>

This heatmap shows the hours of each day when most rides take place. 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM seem to have the most density during the week. On the weekends, the majority of rides take place between the hours of 9 AM and 7 PM.

<h3> Hourly Trips per Day by Gender </h3>

When the hourly trip data is divided by gender, the patterns are pretty similar. For males and females, 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM are consistently the hours with the most density during the week, while 9 AM to 7 PM are fairly evenly dense on the weekends. However, between the hours of 10 AM to 4 PM, there is a significant amount of density for males and less for females. For unknown, the data is pretty evenly spread out, except for on the weekends when most rides seem to take place between the hours of 10 AM and 7 PM.

<h3> User Trips by Gender </h3>

Males who are subscribers constitute the vast majority of users, according to the data. 

<h3> Top Starting Locations </h3>

This image shows the many locations of where riders start their rides. The area to the left of the textbox seems to be very concentrated with popular starting locations.

## Summary
To summarize:
<ul>
  <li> 8 AM, 4 PM, 5 PM, 6 PM, and 7 PM are the most common hours for bike rides.</li>
  <li> Most rides last for 5 minutes. </li>
  <li> Trip duration for males is mostly for 5 minutes, while females and unknown are less concentrated, especially for unknown (evenly spread between 7-25 minutes).</li>
  <li> For males and females, 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM are the hours with the most density during the week, while 9 AM to 7 PM are most dense on the weekends. For unknown, rides are evenly spread throughout the week, and slightly more concentrated between 10 AM and 7 PM on the weekends.</li>
  <li> The largest subset of users is male subscribers, by far.</li>
  <li> The area with the highest concentration of ride starting locations likely has a high amount of tourist traffic.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, the data could be used to determine which hours during the day are best for maintenance (based on hours of lowest usage/downtime) or we could mark popular landmarks on the map to determine which attractions are attracting riders the most, which could be useful for adding more start/stop locations.
